## Requirements

We recommend using Python **3.10** for this project. Ensure you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31015/) installed.

## Installation

To install the required packages, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you encounter any missing package errors or conflicts, you may need to resolve them by installing the specific packages manually. Check the error messages for guidance.

## Running the Application

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Flask will print the address where the app is running (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/). You can open this address in your web browser to access the application.
